Quantum Chromodynamics - Quark Squeezer, produce gluons from quarks

250 photon collectors seems to be a bit of a major milestone
.. 200 assemblers hit a little while before 250 pc's


NB to get the smallest build dist:
ng build --prod --build-optimizer
- tested with nginx, most basic conf:

server {
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/bu;

    try_files $uri $uri/ index.html =404;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/bu_error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/bu_access.log;

    gzip on;
    gzip_disable "msie6";
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;

The commonly accepted answer for the number of particles in the observable 
universe is 10^80. This number would include the total of the number of 
protons, neutrons, neutrinos and electrons.

SI UNIT PREFIXES:
=================
https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/prefixes.html


TODO 2018-01-18
===============

1. (DONE) Number formats on purchase buttons
- option 1: take code from DecimalPipe and call it from every research/machine 
to format displayCOst()
- option 2: convert displayCOst() to a hash of string/number pairs and format 
in the display component
- option 3: write a custom formatter for each unit type, MeV, GeV, TeV etc.

2. (DONE) Interrupt long-running research
- Paradox Generator, paradoxes disrupt philosophers
- some cost and time for buying a paradox, increases with use

3. (DONE) Interrupt long-running construction
- Thermal Spanner - some recovery time for assemblers after use
 - constant seconds? related to work done so far? total cost of project?

4. (DONE) Number formats in meters
- just need a review of them all

5. Heating rate display
- currently thermometer doesn't show the rate of change?

6. (PROBLEMATIC) Dampen energy meter rate of change to reduce flipping - 

7. Some way to enable bulk purchase
- press-and-hold on a button produces popup with more options?
- need to ensure it's aware not everything can be bulk purchased

8. (DONE) Some use for idle philosophers in late-stage game
- possibly to enhance assembly plants which get a bit slow later on

9. Add some kind of analytics/callback
- monitor how many people start
- monitor how many people are reaching the end

10. (PARTIAL) Deployment panel gets quite cluttered
- (DONE) should I remove early machines by limiting? e.g. only 20 quark squeezers etc?
- could move things into related panels.. but that might unbalance the whole display
- (DONE) Just ordering the buttons or grouping might help
- (DONE) and sorting the number formats (see [1] above)

11. Add link to Reddit forum thread for feedback?
https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/7qzn8k/new_cosmologybased_game_seeking_alpha_feedback/



PASER balancing
================

Reduce initial multiplier a lot (2.5x?)
- use Paser efficiency for this.

Extra research: 
Q-switching
Mode locking

 - enhance paser efficiency, which means we have to retrospectively enhance
 photon collector efficiency as the pasers are normally a one-shot eff gain.
 - or we change the photon collector algorithm to take into account the number of pasers
 and the current paser efficiency.


UNSUPERVISED running
====================

First build a supervisor (research something first?)

Offline running only goes at e.g. 10%, you have to improve it through subsequent builds/research


POST 0.2.6:
===========

Need two levels of intelligent assembly, to moderate the boost when first researched
 - too powerful right now. The higher level should be insane - e.g. 100,000 science

Hide matter collector after first Matter Funnel built
- add a show/hide toggle button like the "generate paradox" or "spanner" ones..

Find a suitable icon for the paradox generator 
- (and maybe for the new detector toggle, see above)
