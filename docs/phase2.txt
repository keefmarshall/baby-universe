baryogenesis occurs before Hadrons form, subtly unbalancing
so.. in hadron epoch, matter/antimatter annihilation reduces nearly everything
but matter remains due to the baryogenesis imbalance

====================================================
Game mechanics
====================================================

We have quarks.
We need: 
- hadrons (baryons and mesons)
- baryons (protons, neutrons, made from 3 quarks)
- mesons (pion, kaon etc, made from 1 quark + 1 antiquark)
- leptons (electrons, muons, neutrinos etc)

- elemental atoms
- molecules? <- probably only basic stuff, H2, O2 etc? as would be found in space
- salts? <- presumably needed for planets?

stars - to generate higher elements - different types of star produces different elements
nebulae / clouds etc to generate stars
cosmis rays required for some elements
galaxies?
planets?
Black holes

baryogenesis - how do we stop all the antimatter destroying all our matter?
(maybe we pipe it all to the antimatter dimensions game! meta!)

presumably need gravity - and nuclear forces - to pull stuff together

ENTROPY

what on earth is the end goal?!
- create a black hole with a new baby universe and prestige?
- create a planet with life and go down an evolution route (Phase 4/5?)
   - suspect phase 3 is stars, might need basic molecules (H2, H2O)
     phase 4 maybe planets / salts
     which makes phase 5 complex molecules and maybe life is even phase 6
- watch your universe slowly die of heat death? <- this sounds boring!

- Simply to generate all the (naturally occurring - up to 94) elements? <- might be a better option

- all of the above?


ENERGY / DRIVE

What is driving the game? matter/antimatter annihilation produces a stack of energy
- fusion in stars produces a lot of energy
- are we going to harvest this? 
- or just use the matter we have?
- or go back to harvesting photons from the vacuum, which will still be there?


PROCESS
-------

Already have Quarks and Gluons
-> discover the Strong Interaction (need something to research with)
-> discover Hadrons (things made from quarks, glued together with gluons)
-> discover types of Hadron (Baryons / Mesons)
-> build Baryons / Mesons (need one or more machines for this)
-> Discover Leptons
-> types of Lepton (electrons, muons, taus, neutrinos)
-> Baryon Annihilation - antimatter/matter collisions produce Leptons..?
-> different patterns of annihilation for different combinations? Discover patterns? Machines?
-> Baryogenesis, somehow end up with more matter than antimatter - need a machine

.. problem: need something to research with, some way to build machines, something to build
them from that has an increasing cost

Increasing cost could simply be time - works for research.
Takes time to build machines with a basic constructor - so everything is like Assembly.
Improve by building more or better construction tools.

So how do we bootstrap the most basic constructor? Something that breaks after the first x uses?

Hadron creators can be assigned percentage wise to different 'patterns' to create different hadrons..
.. same with Baryon Annihilators, and so on.


Hadron patterns: can we make this a visual game of some kind, rather than just research?
or: research gives you a recipe - e.g. uud, which you have to enter into the machine

A later upgrade allows an automated recipe selector

Universe is slowly cooling. After it cools below (x?) the baryons start annihilating
so you will lose everything until you discover Baryogenesis - but annihilation will
produce leptons? Do we have to discover these first?

Top right ticker shows universe temp during phase 2

NB Phase 2 ends when you have Hydrogen (and Helium? Need somewhere for the neutrons!)
(add Gravity?)
Phase 3 is for creating elements and stars? Dunno if this warrants a major phase change
 - only if we've converted all the quarks into Baryons, Mesons, Leptons - which we 
 probably do need to do as free quarks are technically not allowed below a certain temperature..


Basic / Crude / Coarse / Contrived Constructor
Entropic Engine (er)
Baryon Builder
Meson Manufacturer / Maker

Rudimentary Researcher
Kaonic Composer / Computer / Contraption

Primitive Patterner
Pionic Patterner / Professor - runs on Pions? Requires Pions to build?

Use Mesons as building blocks for machines (otherwise do they even have a use?)
- check what the decay patterns are

At some point we need radioactive decay - W and Z bosons


DECAY PATHS
===========

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Particles/qrkdec.html

.. turns out it's quite hard to get definitive answers to particle decay paths
Every particle has a branching model, with different percentage chances of decaying
down certain paths over others.

But, these branching models don't appear to be well documented, perhaps not well understood?
Especially for the top quark - I can't find a simple branching model for this anywhere.

half lives
----------

We have to play fast and loose here as otherwise everything will decay instantly
(t has half life of 5e-25!)

let's say we want everything to decay over 2 hours

t's will decay quicker than that - so say 30 minutes (need to allow time to 
discover different decay patterns, otherwise the game is no fun)

(maths note: technically the figures are often given as average life not half life
which is 1.44 * half life - the difference is negligible from our point of view)

b = 1e-12
c = 1e-13
s = 1e-8

The orders-of-magnitude differences mean we have to fudge this, big time.

so: use logs.

log10 for topq =~ -25

we have e.g. 1 octillion = 1e27

N(t) = number after t
N = original number
l = decay constant* ~ 0.7/half life

N(t) = N * e^(-lt)

N(t) / N = e^(-lt)
ln(Nt / N) = -lt

t = ln(Nt / N) / -l
t =~ -ln(Nt/N) * halflife (approx)

ln(1e-27) = -62.1

so if t ~ 1800, we need halflife to be ~30
If t ~ 7200, halflife is 120

so what formula makes 1e-25 into 30 and 1e-8 into 120ish

750 / -log10(n) = 30 & 93 - pretty close.



NEW IDEAS (2018-05-23)
=========

Watching stuff decay is boring, let's give the player some control

So: Decay Engine/Oven/Generator/something(s) (Bosonator?) - hard to build,
each one can decay only one (type of) particle at a time. You only get 
the patterns you've discovered so far. 

Does mean we need to go back to branching ratios...

Annihilation and Baryogenesis:
-----------------------------
Seems that baryon annihilation is messy, no-one has clearly defined 
a set of obvious branching ratios taht I can find, maybe in the deep
literature there might be some. So, different tack:

1. Annihilation just leads to lots of energy. We can harness thiss
to do other stuff, it becomes a currency. <- to do what?

Obviously we need an Annihilator, which we feed baryons/antibaryons


2. Some people link Baryogenesis to Dark Matter - we can't annihilate
everything or there'll be nothing left, so maybe have a Dark Matter
generator that works on antimatter alone. This is wild speculation
outside Physics but there are some theories which loosely point towards
the connection between the two.

Leptogenesis:
-------------
We also need to annihilate Leptons, favouring matter over antimatter.
We need ideally an identical number of electrons as protons leftover
to balance universal charge - no idea how to do this.

Maybe antileptons can be used to generate Dark Energy. Pure fiction now.

Dark Matter / Dark Energy
-------------------------
Basically macguffins to explain stuff. No-one knows what they are so we
could go wild or simply ignore them. - we may need them later on during
universe expansion though.
