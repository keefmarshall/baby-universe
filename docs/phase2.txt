baryogenesis occurs before Hadrons form, subtly unbalancing
so.. in hadron epoch, matter/antimatter annihilation reduces nearly everything
but matter remains due to the baryogenesis imbalance

Edward Tryon, “The Universe is simply one of those things which happens from time to time.”

This one is a better summary, and goes further in subsequent pages:

"collisional excitation", “monolithic collapse.”, "hierarchical clustering"
angular momentum
Seems like dark matter may have been required.. might ignore that.




====================================================
Game mechanics
====================================================

We have quarks.
We need: 
- hadrons (baryons and mesons)
- baryons (protons, neutrons, made from 3 quarks)
- mesons (pion, kaon etc, made from 1 quark + 1 antiquark)
- leptons (electrons, muons, neutrinos etc)

- elemental atoms
- molecules? <- probably only basic stuff, H2, O2 etc? as would be found in space
- salts? <- presumably needed for planets?

stars - to generate higher elements - different types of star produces different elements
nebulae / clouds etc to generate stars
cosmis rays required for some elements
galaxies?
planets?
Black holes

baryogenesis - how do we stop all the antimatter destroying all our matter?
(maybe we pipe it all to the antimatter dimensions game! meta!)

presumably need gravity - and nuclear forces - to pull stuff together

ENTROPY

what on earth is the end goal?!
- create a black hole with a new baby universe and prestige?
- create a planet with life and go down an evolution route (Phase 3?)
- watch your universe slowly die of heat death? <- this sounds boring!

- Simply to generate all the (naturally occurring - up to 94) elements? <- might be a better option

- all of the above?


ENERGY / DRIVE

What is driving the game? matter/antimatter annihilation produces a stack of energy
- fusion in stars produces a lot of energy
- are we going to harvest this? 
- or just use the matter we have?
- or go back to harvesting photons from the vacuum, which will still be there?
